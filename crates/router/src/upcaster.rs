//! UpcasterDispatch — an upcaster's rules: the client library's side of the
//! upcaster sidecar's `UpcasterService.Upcast` (decisions 14.39, 14.96 and
//! 14.97; docs/design/upcasting.md §6). An upcaster is part of the
//! component whose streams it upcasts, never a component of its own: it has
//! no kind and no descriptor, and a business process hosting it hosts
//! nothing else (ANGZARR_REASON_UPCASTER_WITH_COMPONENT is the host's).
//!
//! A rule brings one payload type to a newer shape. Each payload is
//! brought through every rule its type reaches, in turn, each rule at most
//! once (a v1 to v2 rule, then v2 to v3; a rule re-encoding its own type
//! runs once), and is answered as is when no rule applies. The answer is
//! keyed, never positional: a stream page by its sequence, a lone command
//! or fact payload by `NoSequence` (decision 14.97). A page's sequence and
//! EventMeta are the coordinator's and stay as stored, so a rule sees and
//! answers the payload alone. A rule that fails is a rule bug (decision
//! 14.37), with no key of its own.
